# admin-dashboard

About:
This is my version of the Admin Dashboard project from The Odin Project. I really enjoyed working with CSS grid and the simplicity of laying out a web page. I also liked being able to use CSS flex for some of the smaller parts of the layout, for example laying out the content of the sidebar.

Technologies used:
HTML, CSS

Lessons Learned:
This project is one where I really felt I had a deeper understanding of the DOM and how it interacts with layout styling. This is the first time I've used CSS grid and I really enjoy using it. This feels like my first project where I was using CSS intentionally, rather than guessing at what things do. Even if my understanding of a CSS rule was wrong, I was being intentional when trying the rule.

For the future I think some things that I need to work on are: - Keeping up to date with my Git commits - I made a mistake in this project and did not have a version to revert to - Taking a little more time with CSS Grid layout in the initial layout phase. - Using em, rem, calc and % instead of using px everywhere. I think it will lead to more responsive web pages in the future.
